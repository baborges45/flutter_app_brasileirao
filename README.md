# app_brasileirao

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a project built in Flutter application.

The idea of this application is to be practicing all the concepts of a flutter app:

- How to make simple navigation between pages;
- Demonstrating in a basic way the passing of parameters;
- The validation and control of forms and the use of the Tab Widget;

Then we'll look at more advanced techniques and patterns for state management and cross-page navigation.
